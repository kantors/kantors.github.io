          <p>Design is a powerful tool, one that can create both positive and negative change in the world. It is easy to see how digital products developed by designers at companies like Facebook and Google have revolutionized the way the world communicates and learns. But, not everyone considers the fact that every process, policy and product was created by intentional problem solving, or in other words, by design. Once the concept of design is broadened to include anything built with intention, one can clearly see the power it has in shaping societies. To innovate and solve complex problems, designers use a wide range of tools and processes. One particularly powerful tool is the Design Thinking process, a collaborative methodology deployed as a way to solve problems using both logic and creativity. It is a human-centered design approach that forces the designer to focus and empathize with the needs and limitations of the end user. This process is used among both designers and non-designers across many different fields as a way of systematically innovating. A common misconception is that design is only for those that consider themselves creative.  In fact, design is another form of problem solving and a powerful cross-disciplinary tool.

              Design is often confused with art. Though they have similarities, good design emphasizes function and ease of use, neither of which are essential for good art. It is this emphasis that allows design to be applied to so many different disciplines. As a result, the term “designer“ encompasses people working in a wide range of fields. For example, digital designers work on apps and websites, while someone involved in user experience could be designing the way a traveler checks their luggage at the airport. An engineer can also be seen as a type of designer. They design products and systems using mathematical techniques and analysis. Despite the diversity in the design field, all design involves the same basic problem solving skills. Designers must identify their users and the problems their products need to solve.
          </p>
          <p>There are two main aspects to designing products: usability and aesthetics. Usability is how the product functions. It determines the product’s layout, information flow and visual hierarchy. Designers strive to create products whose design is consistent and intuitive to the user. For example, when designing a door, the designer would consider how a user would perceive the handle. If the handle is well designed, the user would immediately know whether to push or pull on the door. On the other hand, aesthetics determine the look and feel of the product. In the same example, the designer might consider the material of the door, using glass and steel to create a sleek and elegant look and feel. Aesthetics is also the basis of a branding. It can determine if the brand is desirable and trusted. Both usability and aesthetics are important factors in the success of a product.</p>
          <p>In their article, “What Is Design Thinking And Why Is It Important?” Razzouk and Shute synthesize current research done in the field of Design Thinking in order to understand what makes an expert in Design Thinking as well as to investigate how design thinking can be applied in the education system. The format of the article is clear and set up in a way that helps to support Razzouk and Shute’s arguments. By beginning with an in-depth overview of Design Thinking, they build up their credibility as experts on the topic. Only after having summarized the research do Razzouk and Shute begin to discuss their own arguments. This helps frame their arguments by giving the reader sufficient context. For example, before beginning their discussion on the characteristics of a Design Thinking expert, Razzouk and Shute define the differences between a novice and expert in the field. In addition, the visuals that the authors use are all successful in contributing to the article without overcomplicating the discussion. In particular, the table describing the characteristics of a design thinking expert helps visualizing the authors points by presenting the information in a clear and concise way. The authors conclude the essay by applying the Design Thinking process to the education system.  This section was particularly interesting because Razzouk and Shute were able to expand on the current research to demonstrate a novel example of how Design Thinking can be used. Overall, Razzouk and Shute are successful in their goal of educating the reader while contributing to the current body of research.

              Design Thinking is both a way of thinking and a set of iterative processes. The first stage of the process begins by using empathy to understand the user.  Interviews as well as observation are used to investigate the user’s needs. Once the user research has been analyzed, the designer is able to clearly articulate and define the problem. The designer then brainstorms potential solutions and begins developing them. Once a prototype has been made, it is tested, and then the process starts again at the brainstorming stage in order to continually improve and refine the solution. This iterative process allows the designer to focus on experimentation and the exploration of multiple solutions. From their research, Razzouk and Shute emphasize the importance of these iterations, “Indeed, the quality of the end product can be enhanced if a number of smaller ideas are explored first” (Razzouk and Shute).

              A common misconception is that inherent creativity is essential to being a good Design Thinker. From their findings, Razzouk and Shute are able to compile a list of characteristics that define an expert in design thinking, “Human and environment-centered concern, the ability to visualize, predisposition toward multifunctionality, a systemic vision, the ability to use language as a tool, an affinity for teamwork and the ability to avoid the necessity of choice” (Razzouk & Shute). It is often thought that people are born with creativity. Razzouk and Shute disagree.  They argue, “The major difference between experts and novices is that experts have accumulated a large number of examples of problems and solutions in a specific domain of interest.“ In other words, practice and experience are the true determinants of an expert design thinker rather than creative genius or artistic skill. Processes like Design Thinking are built to bring creativity and innovation out of anyone. As a result, an expert in the Design Thinking process does not need to be a traditional designer or even someone who considers themselves creative. Creativity, like any other skill, can be learned and built upon.

              Innovation and problem solving are important skills in every profession. Design Thinking makes both of these skills more accessible. In business, Design Thinking’s focus on the user as well as its ability to create innovative solutions can give companies a competitive advantage. Systematic problem solving is an essential process in the engineering of any product. In fact, many engineers and scientists practice parts of the design process without ever being aware of it. Problem solving is a universal skill, and teaching it in a classroom setting could have a profound impact on students. In the last section of their article, Razzouk and Shute extend their current research to apply to the education system, “ ...the premise is that by improving students’ design thinking skills through having them apply processes and methods that designers use to ideate and help them experience how designers approach problems to try to solve them, students will be more ready to face problems, think outside of the box, and come up with innovative solutions” (Razzouk and Shute). Currently, the application of the Design Thinking process are under-explored in many different disciplines and contexts. The addition of Design Thinking to a course curriculum is a powerful way of emphasizing the importance of design as well as teaching students valuable skills. Razzouk and Shute expand on the importance of Design Thinking as a teaching tool, “We believe that design thinking is more than just a skill to be acquired and used in limited contexts. Rather, we view it as a way of thinking and being that can potentially enhance the epistemological and ontological nature of schooling.”(Razzouk and Shute). By introducing Design Thinking in a classroom, students will be better prepared to enter a workforce that relies heavily on continually innovation and problem solving.

              Design, and specifically the Design Thinking process, is a powerful tool for solving complex problems.  For those working in fast-paced companies on the cutting-edge of their industries, creativity and innovation become essential for success. However, Design Thinking has the potential to be far more than just a process for innovation. It is also a way of thinking that continually forces those using it to step back and reconsider the end user. This is the key to successful problem solving. It is already used in many different fields today. And even used by people who don’t believe that they have the creativity or artistic skills to be a designer.  In fact, without even realizing it, they have become designers, practicing the most fundamental principles of design.
