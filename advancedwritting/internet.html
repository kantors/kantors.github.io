            <h1>What does the Internet know about you?</h1>
            <p>Facebook, Google and Amazon know the intimate details of every search that you make. For example, Google saves every single search you have ever entered as well as every ad you click. Amazon uses your purchase data to recommend more products.
                Facebook data can identify your political views, sexual orientation, and personality traits. This data is used to personalize your feed with posts, articles and other media that you are likely to agree and interact with. All of this data
                is given away through your decision to use the particular online product and is outlined in the terms of service agreements.</p>
            <p>However, there is also certain data that websites and apps can collect without any explicit agreement. For example, every web browser knows where you are, what device you are using and what online accounts (Twitter, Facebook etc.) that you
                are currently logged into.</p>
            <p>Your phone also tracks some interesting data. For example, your phone knows how fast you are driving (and whether you are speeding), who you hang out with and where you live. Every photo you take is also stamped with meta-data that includes
                both location and time of the photo.</p>
