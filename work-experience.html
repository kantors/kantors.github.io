                <p>Currently, I lead the Labs team at Scout Studio. As Labs Director, I manage an interdisciplinary team of students that use design thinking to tackle social issues in the Boston area. In addition to selecting the team and preparing the
                    project timeline, I also partnered with the Center for Community Service at Northeastern to recruit our client. We are now working directly with our client to design and build a website that uses storytelling and journalism to connect
                    people across different Boston. </p>

                <h2>Datawheel: Web Developer Intern</h2>
                <p>My previous internships have given me extensive experience in both web design and development. As a web developer intern at Datawheel, I led the development of a web application that allows companies to list themselves under the products
                    they import and export and the countries they operate in. I developed features such as user authentication, admin settings and search using React, Node.js and PostgreSQL. I also assisted with the deployment of the site using Amazon
                    Web Services.</p>

                <p>As a developer and designer at Scout Studio, I worked on a small team to design and develop the front-end for a social e-commerce app using AngularJs and Ionic. During the course of the project I participated in weekly meetings with the
                    client to go over market research as well as defining brand, personas and user testing questions. </p>

                <h2>Huntington News: Designer and Developer</h2>
                <p>I spent all of 2016 working at Huntington News, Northeastern’s independent newspaper. During my time there, I designed and developed a custom Wordpress Theme using PHP that was used on the website. I also built custom plugins and widgets
                    to improve the site’s usability for its editors. My other work included maintaining the site, providing technical support, and monitoring engagement using Google Analytics.</p>

                <h2>Continuum: Web Developer Intern</h2>
                <p>As a web development intern at Continuum, I developed the new homepage, product pages and navigation menu for Continuum’s website redesign using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Beyond that, I updated and maintained the current webpages and custom
                    modules using HubSpot CMS. I also built custom modules and email templates using HubSpot’s server-side language, HubL.</p>

                <p>My combination of both design and development skills gives me a broader perspective, one that helps me bridge the gap between the design and development of a product. I understand what it means to work hard and to be a supportive and accountable
                    team member. Finally, I also bring a passion for problem solving, creativity and a strong eye for design. </p>
